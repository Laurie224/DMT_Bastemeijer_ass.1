            <h2>Curriculum Vitae for BDMS</h2>

        <p>This is my resume for the course 'Digital Media Technology' at <a href= "http://www.leiden.edu" style="color:#606060"> Leiden University</a>.</p>
            
        <h3>About me</h3>
        
        <p>
           In 2018, I obtained my BA in Russian studies. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Book and Digital Media Studies.<br>
           Since 2017, I work as a publicity assistant for a small <a href= "https://www.pegasusboek.nl" style="color:#606060"> publishing house</a> in Amsterdam. In my spare time, I am the <br> 
           Editor-in-Chief of an online magazine for LGBT+ youth in the Netherlands, <a href= "http://www.expreszo.nl" style="color:#606060">Expreszo</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Previously, I have been been the Treasurer for my Study Association and a student assistant. Sometimes I get <i>paid</i><br> 
        to write articles or blog posts, which is still a pretty wild concept to me.         
            
        </p>

                    <td style="width:20"><b>Prior Knowledge</b></td> <td>Thanks to my earlier work as an editor and content marketeer, I have some knowledge of the structure<br> 
                        of digital texts. However, my knowledge mostly relates to the SEO aspect and I have never programmed<br> 
                        anything myself before.</td>

                <tr>
                    <td style= "width:20"><b>Expectations</b></td> <td>I hope to gain new insights in the broad variety of programmes used in creating, organising and analysing <br> 
                        digital media and their users. Although book fanatics may never get tired of some good old printed books,<br> 
                        I believe digitally published work to be just as amazing. Therefore, I wish to continue with 'Digital Text and<br>
                        Data Processing' in the second semester.</td>
